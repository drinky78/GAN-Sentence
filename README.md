# GAN-Sentence
Generate a new book/essay using GAN-Recurrent-LSTM on Tensorflow

![alt text](gan-sentence.png)

I still take original idea of GAN for cost function (cross entropy, single bit for every sentence), maximise fake sentence logits during generator backpropagate.

GAN model is very sensitive with hyperparameters such momentum constant value, what technique during backpropagate, learning rate, batch size, and here we can do if generator keep loosing very much:

1. you may apply generator training for twice or more.
2. tuned momentum constant in ADAM.
3. change Adaptive RMS into pure RMS
4. Recheck my work for generator sentence

I included the essay also, but you can replaced with any essay. And the generator is word-based generator.

#### Check hyperparameters in main.py first before train
```python
# hyperparameters
learning_rate = 0.0001
length_sentence = 64
batch_size = 20
epoch = 100
num_layers = 2
size_layer = 512
len_noise = 100
```

#### Then,
```bash
python main.py
```

So below is the output
